JsLib is a framework in transition based on the MOVE pattern: Models,
Operations, Views and Events.

Features include:

* Base classes for the entire framework, including a robust model layer
* Low requirements from external libraries
* A focus on behavioral and test driven development
* Minimal compatibility with older browsers

More to come.
